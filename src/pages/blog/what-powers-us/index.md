An overview of various tools and services that were used for building and hosting this website is provided. It is strongly **recommended** to take a look at it.

### Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/ 'Gatsby') is an open source static site generator powered by [React](http://reactjs.org/ 'React'). It enables developers to build _apps_ and _websites_ using [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/ 'JAMstack') and provides modern website building features like _code splitting, pre fetching, PWA_ out of the box.

Posts can be written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ 'Markdown') format and customize it with HTML, CSS and React knowledge. You can bring data from many [sources](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/content-and-data/ 'Gatsby Content and Data') at the time of building the app.
Sites built using Gatsby can be hosted using any static server. Also it can be hosted in [Github pages](https://pages.github.com 'Github Pages') for free.
